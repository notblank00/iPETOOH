# iPETOOH
iPETOOH, simple IDE for PETOOH by Ky6uk.                                              
Documentation for the language: https://github.com/Ky6uk/PETOOH/blob/master/README.md.                                         
Windows version will be soon published in a new branch.                                                         
Now I think about releasing this on OS X also.
